# Project Learnings & Constraints

This document tracks the specific constraints, patterns, and lessons learned *during the development of this project*.

**Rules for this file:**
1.  **Append Only:** Never delete existing learnings unless they are factually incorrect.
2.  **Telegraphic Style:** Be concise. (e.g., "AWS Lambda timeout is 15min" > "I discovered that AWS Lambda has a timeout...").
3.  **Specifics:** Focus on *this* project (API quirks, tech stack limits, user preferences). For general framework rules, refer to `coding/AI_CODING_DIRECTIVES.md`.

## 2. Patterns (The "How")

## 3. Anti-Patterns (What Failed)
